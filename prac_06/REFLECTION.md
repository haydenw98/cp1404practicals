# CP1404 Practical Reflection - Hayden Watts

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Aside from this week due to something coming up I have generally been studying and starting the pracs early in the week
and breaking it up over the days so it doesn't feel overwhelming and I can watch the lectures
at a good pace.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Always time management, but I could be better at including things from the lectures directly
and doing the extension work in the pracs.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

My formatting, naming conventions and understanding of the logic has been solid and I want to
stay on top of the lessons to stay sharp.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Do more extension work from the pracs to build a better foundation.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I'm not too sure I have any real changes. The response time and assistance from lecturers has been
very fast and insightful and the lectures are informative and entertaining. I guess if I could do it
again I would like to have done these in class instead of online but that's not the fault of the course.
