# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

Honestly, I had started off this course and prac without having watched a lecture video and it showed in my
prac 1 code (poor variable naming habit). Since then I have gone back and watched through most of the lecture videos and am currently
watching through week 2 lecture videos so the percentage will change in an hour.
Right now I'd say 70%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?
I have been watching them at my desktop PC at night after work, usually around 9PM - 12PM. Luckily my shifts in the following weeks will be 
easier to study around and I can watch at a more conventional time, though I am a night owl.


## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Right now I feel like my understanding of the code is pretty solid and I do enjoy it coming together and running.
I enjoy and understand functions well and like how compartmentalised you can make your code.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to be more consistent at watching the lectures and practicing throughout the week


## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Its only week 2 and I have mostly caught up but my time management was poor. I am restructuring my roster and will spend more time weekly on the class as I can imagine falling behind easily as it gets more complex.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Following along with the guides.
