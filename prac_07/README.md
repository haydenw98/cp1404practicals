This repository contains my practical python work for my programming 2 class, [CP1404](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals).
## 3 Lessons on clean code I have learned:
+ To refactor when possible, making functions that operate on the SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).
+ Always include docstrings and comments when possible to include readability and understanding of your code.
+ Stick to standard naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, etc. as it improves understanding and makes good coding practice for the future. <br />
<br /> 
+ Using the [Programming Patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns) page has been immensely helpful for staying on track with coding conventions.
